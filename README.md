# Playlist Thy Maker

This is simply some scripts that I use to create Spotify playlists. 

Fun with Spotify API: [make me a playlist.ipynb](make&#32;me&#32;a&#32;playlist.ipynb)

You will need to create a credentials.yaml file that contains the following: 
> spotify\_username: <your username>  
> spotify\_client\_id:  <your client id>    
> spotify\_client\_secret: <your client secret>
